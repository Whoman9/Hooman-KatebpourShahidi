    <h1 id="section-berlin">Berlin</h1>
    <p>
      &emsp; Berlin is the capital and largest city of Germany by both area and
      population. Its 3.8 million inhabitants make it the European Union's most
      populous city, according to population within city limits. One of
      Germany's sixteen constituent states, Berlin is surrounded by the State of
      Brandenburg and contiguous with Potsdam, Brandenburg's capital. Berlin's
      urban area, which has a population of around 4.5 million, is the second
      most populous urban area in Germany after the Ruhr. The Berlin-Brandenburg
      capital region has over six million inhabitants and is Germany's
      third-largest metropolitan region after the Rhine-Ruhr and Rhine-Main
      regions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &emsp; Berlin straddles the banks of the Spree, which flows into the Havel
      (a tributary of the Elbe) in the western borough of Spandau. Among the
      city's main topographical features are the many lakes in the western and
      southeastern boroughs formed by the Spree, Havel and Dahme, the largest of
      which is Lake Müggelsee. Due to its location in the European Plain, Berlin
      is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate. About one-third of the
      city's area is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers, canals and
      lakes. The city lies in the Central German dialect area, the Berlin
      dialect being a variant of the Lusatian-New Marchian dialects.

      &emsp; October 1990, the two parts of Germany were reunified as the
      Federal Republic of Germany, and Berlin again became a reunified city.
      Walter Momper, the mayor of West Berlin, became the first mayor of the
      reunified city in the interim. City-wide elections in December 1990
      resulted in the first "all Berlin" mayor being elected to take office in
      January 1991, with the separate offices of mayors in East and West Berlin
      expiring by that time, and Eberhard Diepgen (a former mayor of West
      Berlin) became the first elected mayor of a reunited Berlin.

    <h1 id="section-berlinWall">Berlin Wall</h1>
    <p>
      &emsp; The Berlin Wall was a guarded concrete barrier that physically and
      ideologically divided Berlin from 1961 to 1989. Construction of the wall
      was commenced by the German Democratic Republic (GDR, East Germany) on 13
      August 1961. The Wall cut off West Berlin from surrounding East Germany,
      including East Berlin. The barrier included guard towers placed along
      large concrete walls, accompanied by a wide area (later known as the
      "death strip") that contained anti-vehicle trenches, beds of nails and
      other defenses. The Eastern Bloc portrayed the Wall as protecting its
      population from fascist elements conspiring to prevent the "will of the
      people" from building a socialist state in East Germany. GDR authorities
      officially referred to the Berlin Wall as the Anti-Fascist Protection
      Rampart (German: Antifaschistischer Schutzwall). The West Berlin city
      government sometimes referred to it as the "Wall of Shame", a term coined
      by mayor Willy Brandt in reference to the Wall's restriction on freedom of
      movement. Along with the separate and much longer Inner German border
      (IGB), which demarcated the border between East and West Germany, it came
      to symbolize physically the "Iron Curtain" that separated Western Europe
      and the Eastern Bloc during the Cold War.
